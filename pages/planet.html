<p>The fact of the matter is that I just enjoy the process of writing. Moving words around a blank page like so many Lego bricks is <em>fun</em>. Skill and readership have very little to do with it. I write to clarify my thoughts. I write to try see if any of my beliefs contradict each other. And, sometimes, I write to discover what I think.</p>

This is an early developer preview of Python 3.9
Python 3.9 is still in development. This release, 3.9.0a6, is the last out of six planned alpha releases. Alpha releases are intended to make it easier to test the current state of new features and bug fixes and to test the release process. During the alpha phase, features may be added up until the start of the beta phase (2020-05-18) and, if necessary, may be modified or deleted up until the release candidate phase (2020-08-10).

  <p>Most programming languages’ grammars fall into the category of Context-Free Grammar (CFG), or sometimes Context-Sensitive Grammar (CSG). What about C++? It turns out parsing C++’s grammar is <em>literally undecidable</em>. In other words, if you have a compiler that parses all valid C++ sources perfectly, you have solved the Halting Problem.</p><img alt="" src="//cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/575/0*8x8YYNM_l9vh1rKE.png">Relationship between various categories of formal languages<p>To prove this, we will write a program that is parsed differently depending on the solution to the Halting Problem. But we need to implement a Turing Machine to formulate the Halting Problem, and doing that with only template metaprogramming is a huge pain, so we will instead use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_correspondence_problem">Post Correspondence Problem</a> which is proven to be equivalent to the Halting Problem.</p><p>The Post Correspondence Problem’s statement is simple: You are given a set of dominoes which have an array …</p>

  <p>We continue working on improving the usability of Cantor. Another important change in 20.04 is the new feature <strong>collapsible cells</strong> which allows the user to collapse the results of a calculation. This is useful when doing many calculation in one worksheet and there is the need to hide some of the results temporarily to get more place in the worksheet or to be less distracted by what is not needed right now. For this, we introduced a new control element for every cell in the worksheet. By double clicking on this new element the result part of the cell is collapsed.</p>

<p>
    <img alt="Hide cantor results" src="//cantor.kde.org/assets/img/hide-results.gif">
</p>

<p>Alternatively, the results can be hidden by selecting “Hide Results” from the context menu of the command entry in the worksheet. This step can be similarly undone to show the results again.</p>

  <p>Tonight I spoke with my girlfriend on the phone and we talked for two hours about all kinds of topics. One topic was that I don’t think corona tracking apps, where the data is stored centrally, are a good idea because of privacy and stuff. My girlfriend, on the other hand, said why is privacy important at all? The argument that nobody needs to know what I do with whom, when, where and for how long was not convincing to her. She said that I track my runs via GPS anyway. And she asked who would be interested in your data if you are not famous or something?</p>
<p>I know that privacy is important to me and I always make sure to use services that are as privacy friendly as possible, but somehow I lack good and convincing arguments …</p>

  With the release of 3.20, LXD was included into the community repository of Arch Linux in January, and has currently been sitting there happily for the past months. LXD is a container manager from Canonical that manages containers as if they where independent machines in a cluster. I have somehow taken to calling them &ldquo;containers-as-machines&rdquo;. This is in contrast to podman and docker which would be &ldquo;containers-as-applications&rdquo;. Think of lxd as ganeti, but for containers.

  The CPython core developers are pleased to announce the immediate availability of Python 2.7.18.

Python 2.7.18 is the last Python 2.7 release and therefore the last Python 2 release. It's time for the CPython community to say a fond but firm farewell to Python 2.

Download this unique, commemorative Python release on <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2718/">python.org</a>.

Python 2.7 has been under active development since the release of Python 2.6, more than 11 years ago. Over all those years, CPython's core developers and contributors sedulously applied bug fixes to the 2.7 branch, no small task as the Python 2 and 3 branches diverged. There were large changes midway through Python 2.7's life such as PEP 466's feature backports to the ssl module and hash randomization. Traditionally, these features would never have been added to …

  <p>As someone who has been often maligned by the disappearance of my data for
various reasons — companies going under, hard drive failure, etc —
and as someone who is responsible for the safekeeping of other people’s data,
I’ve put a lot of thought into solutions for long-term data retention.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of long-term storage, with different concerns: cold storage
and hot storage. The former is like a hard drive in your safe — it stores
your data, but you’re not actively using it or putting wear on the storage
medium. By contrast, hot storage is storage which is available immediately and
undergoing frequent reads and writes.</p>

What storage medium to use?

<p>There are some bad ways to do it. The worst way I can think of is to store
it on a microSD card. These fail <em>a …</em></p>

The PyPy team is proud to release the version 7.3.1 of PyPy, which includes
two different interpreters:

<blockquote>
<div>
<ul>
<li>PyPy2.7, which is an interpreter supporting the syntax and the features of
Python 2.7 including the stdlib for CPython 2.7.13</li>
<li>PyPy3.6: which is an interpreter supporting the syntax and the features of
Python 3.6, including the stdlib for CPython 3.6.9.</li>

The interpreters are based on much the same codebase, thus the multiple

in December, but read on to find out what is new.


Conda Forge now <a href="https://conda-forge.org/blog//2020/03/10/pypy">supports PyPy</a> as a Python interpreter. The support right now

different approaches to this and my view has changed quite a bit.</p>
<p>I strongly believe that contact tracing through phone apps is one of our

  <p>I don't know how I thought the world would look like 10 years ago, but a
pandemic that prevents us from going outside was not what I was picturing.
It's about three weeks now that I and my family are spending at home in
Austria instead of going to work or having the kids at daycare, two of
those weeks were under mandatory social distancing because of SARS-CoV-2.</p>
<p>And as cute as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_distancing">social distancing</a>
and “flattening the curve” sounds at first, the consequences to our daily
lives are beyond anything I could have imagined would happen in my
lifetime.</p>
<p>What is still conveniently forgotten is that the curve really only stays
flat if we're doing this for a very, very long time.  And quite frankly,
I'm not sure for how long our society will be able to do this.  Even …</p>

  As has been discussed in detail in Nadia Eghbal's Roads and Bridges, the CZI EOSS program announcement, and in the NumFocus sustainability program goals, much of the critical software that science and industry are built on is maintained by a primarily volunteer community. While this has worked, it is not sustainable in the long term for the health of many projects or their contributors.
We are happy to announce that we have hired Elliott Sales de Andrade (QuLogic) as the Matplotlib Software Research Engineering Fellow supported by the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative Essential Open Source Software for Science effective March 1, 2020!
