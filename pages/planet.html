<blockquote>
<p>For me, minimalism is a <em>choice</em>. It’s an attempt to reduce my footprint on an overburdened planet. It’s about having <em>enough</em> and not much more. At a material level, minimalism is a focus on what you <em>need</em> rather than on what you <em>want</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Minimalism isn’t a race to the bottom. It’s not a competition to see how much of your life you can pare away, how many material goods you can shuck aside. No. Minimalism is an <em>understanding</em>. An understanding of the minimum of what you need to life a fulfilling life, to live a comfortable life. For each of us, the …</p></blockquote>

      Backup a dockerized Postgres database with Resticker

  </h1>
  <div class="p-summary">
  <p>I got the question how to solve the problem that when backing up the storage of a dockerized Postgres database (using Resticker) it could be that the backup is corrupt because the database is still running.</p>
<p><em>This is an addition to <a href="https://jlelse.blog/dev/restic-docker/">my post of how to backup Docker volumes using resticker</a>.</em></p>
<p>I had exactly the same problem. I wanted to backup a Postgres database running in a Docker container without having to stop the database or have a corrupt backup.</p>
<p>Therefore I have extended Resticker, so that it is possible to <a href="https://github.com/djmaze/resticker#execute-commands-prior-to-backup">execute additional commands before the backup execution</a>. To access other Docker containers, the Docker socket must be mounted. So it is possible to create a database dump and backup it instead of the volume of the database itself.</p>
<p>Here’s the relevant part from the <a href="https://github.com/djmaze/resticker">Resticker</a> documentation:</p>

A Flatpak getting started video tutorial

<p>Joining my mates at <a href="https://hacklabalmeria.net">HackLab Almería</a>, who took the initiative of a set of video talks supporting the <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23YoMeQuedoEnCasa">#YoMeQuedoEnCasa</a> initiative fighting against the boredom COVID-19 confinement in Spain (thanks <a href="https://github.com/zerasul">Víctor</a>), I felt ready enough to give <a href="https://hacklabalmeria.net/actividades/2020/04/14/Flatpak_introduccion_supervivencia.html">a talk about guerrilla Flatpak packaging</a> using as examples my work on recent bundles:</p>

<div>
  <div>
    <div></div>

<p>Talk is in Spanish. If interested you can ask or comment at the <a href="http://foro.hacklabalmeria.net/t/flatpak-de-supervivencia-para-recien-llegados-hacklab-almeria/11039/2">HLA forum entry</a>. The recording quality is not good enough: it’s the first time I record a talk with the amazing <a href="https://obsproject.com/">OBS</a> application. It’s not a great work but it does the job.</p>

      How to store data forever

  <div class="p-summary">
  <p>As someone who has been often maligned by the disappearance of my data for
various reasons — companies going under, hard drive failure, etc —
and as someone who is responsible for the safekeeping of other people’s data,
I’ve put a lot of thought into solutions for long-term data retention.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of long-term storage, with different concerns: cold storage
and hot storage. The former is like a hard drive in your safe — it stores
your data, but you’re not actively using it or putting wear on the storage
medium. By contrast, hot storage is storage which is available immediately and

  In this, hopefully short, article I want to summarize what I&rsquo;ve did for changing the expiration date of my GPG key on my Yubikey. This tutorial is for all people who has generated their GPG key on their laptop and then transferred it to the Yubikey. If you&rsquo;ve generated the GPG key pair on the Yubikey, you will not need this.
We need to differentiate between two cases: Changing the expiration date of a subkey or changing the expiration date of your GPG master key.

  The CPython core developers are pleased to announce the immediate availability of Python 2.7.18.

Python 2.7.18 is the last Python 2.7
release and therefore the last Python 2 release. It's time for the CPython
community to say a fond but firm farewell to Python 2.

Download this unique, commemorative Python release on <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2718/">python.org</a>.

Python 2.7 has been under active development since the release of Python 2.6,
more than 11 years ago. Over all those years, CPython's core developers and
contributors sedulously applied bug fixes to the 2.7 branch, no small task as
the Python 2 and 3 branches diverged. There were large changes midway through
Python 2.7's life such as PEP 466's feature backports to the ssl module and
hash randomization. Traditionally, these features would never have been added

I favor now accuracy of volumes over beauty of the lines. The preparatory sketch for this style disappears totally anyway under the next steps.  I switched to a low opacity thin brush preset very similar to a 4H pencil to slice volumes with more accuracy. My large IntuosXL and the QuadHD monitor mix perfectly for that. I enjoy sketching with it. I'm still trying to see how I can simplify this step further by drawing only the main volumes and big shapes (and not an early rendition of the artwork). it can save probably dozens of minute per panels.</p>

Health care personnel (HCP) are essential workers defined as paid and unpaid persons serving in health care settings who have the potential for direct or indirect exposure to patients or infectious materials (3).

  The zn_poly package prior to version 0.9.2-2 was missing a soname link. 
This has been fixed in 0.9.2-2, so the upgrade will need to overwrite the 
untracked files created by ldconfig. If you get an error
<code>zn_poly: /usr/lib/libzn_poly-0.9.so  exists in filesystem

when updating, use
<code>pacman -Syu --overwrite usr/lib/libzn_poly-0.9.so

  <div>
The PyPy team is proud to release the version 7.3.1 of PyPy, which includes
two different interpreters:

<blockquote>
<div>
<ul>
<li>PyPy2.7, which is an interpreter supporting the syntax and the features of
Python 2.7 including the stdlib for CPython 2.7.13</li>
<li>PyPy3.6: which is an interpreter supporting the syntax and the features of
Python 3.6, including the stdlib for CPython 3.6.9.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</blockquote>
The interpreters are based on much the same codebase, thus the multiple
release. This is a micro release, no APIs have changed since the 7.3.0 release
in December, but read on to find out what is new.


Conda Forge now <a href="https://conda-forge.org/blog//2020/03/10/pypy">supports PyPy</a> as a Python interpreter. The support right now
is being built out. After this release, many more c-extension-based
packages can be successfully built and uploaded. This is the result …</div>

  <p>I have already talked here before about <a href="http://lucumr.pocoo.org/3/contact-tracing/">privacy preserving contact
tracing</a> to fight Covid-19 but I figured I
give an update to this.  I have spent the last week now investigating
different approaches to this and my view has changed quite a bit.</p>
<p>I strongly believe that contact tracing through phone apps is one of our
best chances to return to normal and without losing our civil liberties.
If you want to understand why, have a look at <a href="http://lucumr.pocoo.org/3/contact-tracing/">previous post about this
topic</a>.</p>

Two Fundamental Approaches
<p>In the previous post I talked in favour of a partially centralized
approach.  This was largely because I felt that one of the inherent
problems of any privacy preserving contact tracing system could be
somewhat mitigated.  That downside is that a person could always use any
such contact tracing system in a way where …</p></div>

  Before COVID19 hit our lives, it was so easy for the student to submit a hard copy.  Now with soft copies being asked for, they and the instructors have to learn a bit. So, I had this programming assignment before COVID19 closed our face-to-face classes.

  As has been discussed in detail in Nadia Eghbal's Roads and Bridges, the CZI EOSS program announcement, and in the NumFocus sustainability program goals, much of the critical software that science and industry are built on is maintained by a primarily volunteer community. While this has worked, it is not sustainable in the long term for the health of many projects or their contributors.
We are happy to announce that we have hired Elliott Sales de Andrade (QuLogic) as the Matplotlib Software Research Engineering Fellow supported by the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative Essential Open Source Software for Science effective March 1, 2020!

  At the end of February ten of us gathered in Leysin, Switzerland to work on
a variety of topics including <a href="https://github.com/pyhandle/hpy/">HPy</a>, <a href="http://buildbot.pypy.org/summary?branch=py3.7">PyPy Python 3.7</a> support and the PyPy
migration to <a href="https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/">Heptapod</a>.

We had a fun and productive week. The snow was beautiful. There was skiing
and lunch at the top of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berneuse">Berneuse</a>, cooking together, some late nights at
the pub next door, some even later nights coding, and of course the
obligatory cheese fondue outing.

There were a few of us participating in a PyPy sprint for the first time
and a few familiar faces who had attended many sprints. Many different
projects were represented including PyPy, <a href="https://github.com/pyhandle/hpy/">HPy</a>, <a href="https://github.com/graalvm/graalpython">GraalPython</a>,
<a href="https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/">Heptapod</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/dgrunwald/rust-cpython">rust-cpython</a>. The atmosphere was relaxed and welcoming, so if
you're thinking of attending the next one -- please do!
