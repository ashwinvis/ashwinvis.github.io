Here is a showcase of all the projects I co-develop, have contributed
to, or maintain myself:

Research Software
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`FluidDyn project <https://fluiddyn.bitbucket.io>`__ 
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

An ecosystem of packages for research and teaching in fluid dynamics.

Some key features include:

-  `FluidDyn <https://fluiddyn.readthedocs.io>`__: Classes to manage
   parameters, large sets of files, named numpy arrays, scripting job
   submissions in clusters, MPI wrappers to easily implement sequential
   and parallel programming.
-  `FluidFFT <https://fluidfft.readthedocs.io>`__: Unified Python and
   C++ API for various sequential and MPI & GPU accelerated FFT
   implementations.
-  `FluidSim <https://fluidsim.readthedocs.io>`__: Arguably one of
   fastest CFD framework specializing in pseudospectral solvers, with
   on-the-fly post processing. Example of a research done using
   FluidSim:

-  `FluidImage <https://fluidimage.readthedocs.io>`__: Calibrate,
   pre-process and perform PIV on large sets of images asynchronously
   and with open-source software.
-  `FluidDevOps <https://bitbucket.org/fluiddyn/fluiddevops>`__: Nifty
   CLI tools to help ease the development workflow.

`Caeroc <https://github.com/ashwinvis/caeroc>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

An toy desktop GUI calculator for compressible aerodynamics built on top
of `scikit-aero <https://github.com/AeroPython/scikit-aero>`__. Demo:

Open-Source contributions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I have also contributed some serious projects such as:

-  `Pythran <https://pythran.readthedocs.io>`__: An ahead-of-time
   compiler for creating blazing fast Python extensions from Pure python
   or NumPy code. I contributed to:

   -  improvements in Pythran extension build process
      (`link <https://github.com/serge-sans-paille/pythran/pull/941>`__)
   -  linting Pythran configuration files
      (`link <https://github.com/serge-sans-paille/pythran/pull/1145>`__)

-  `Jupyterlab <https://jupyterlabe.readthedocs.io>`__: Next generation
   UI for Jupyter notebooks. I have:

   -  added access to solarized theme for the text editor
      (`link <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4445>`__)
   -  fixed font rendering in the terminal
      (`link <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5732>`__)

-  `PyMC3 <https://github.com/ashwinvis/pymc3>`__: Probabilistic
   programming in Python. I have:

   -  improved the overall structure of documentation
      (`link <https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc3/pull/3303>`__)

Humble projects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some repositories that I maintain for my personal use and possible
reuse.

-  `Backdrop theme <https://github.com/ashwinvis/backdrop-theme>`__: A
   responsive pelican theme compiled node, grunt, sass technologies.
-  `Awesome scientific
   writing <https://github.com/ashwinvis/awesome-scientific-writing>`__:
   A curated list of resources for writing scientific documents with
   markup languages.
-  `vim-instant-markdown <https://github.com/ashwinvis/vim-instant-markdown>`__
   & `Instant markdown
   server <https://github.com/ashwinvis/instant-markdown-d>`__: Write
   markdown with instant preview. Suppoorts MathJax as well.
-  `xrandr-extend <https://github.com/ashwinvis/xrandr-extend>`__: CLI
   tool to calculate and use non-HIDPI external displays along with
   HIDPI monitors.
