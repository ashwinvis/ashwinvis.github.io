Travelling with a rout3 map in hand is one thing.

| But have you ever thought of chasing an unknown route, and you have no
| idea where you will end up.
| I used to do it since I was 12, with a new cycle, and all my
| neighbourhood back at Aluva laid out to conquer. Just two summer
| holidays later (i.e. when i turned 14) I had seen it all, I knew every
| grass and gutter. I no longer felt the novelty of getting
| lost... And so, I stopped doing it.

| Seven long years have past. Days had become hectic for me (or so i
| thought; but I was wrong). Of all these years of being in an alien
| city, never did a wild thought occur to start over and wander
| aimlessly. Gng places had been restricted to hangouts with friends
| (not that it's a bad thing...my mind had narrowed, if you see my
| point).

| Until today.
| Woke up at 6. An early breakfast. And a walk through unknown streets,
| and lonely grounds. Away from traffic and madness of the city. Listen
| to the birds sing. Feel the warmth of the golden sun, on a cold
| morning. And smile :)

Small steps to start with. But good enough to start over.

So long computers, movies and society! World is calling.
