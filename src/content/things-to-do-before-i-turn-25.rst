#. Start reading books again.
#. See the world, what lies beyond South India. Live for sometime on the
   other side.
#. I always think inside my mind continuously. If you think I am silent,
   you assumed wrong. I am talking to myself. I really hope to change
   it.
#. I turn into a wild party animal when I am alone. Where is the heck is
   that beast when I need it at real parties?
#. Grab a guitar, preferably nylon strings. Learn it during spare time. 
#. Get a smartphone, just so that I can read e-books for free. Which in
   a way aids Resolution #1
#. Stop controlling my life, and let go for a change. Say yes to
   everything (yea, as in "Yes Man" the movie)
#. And that brings us to.... stop watching so many movies! We all
   realise at the end of the year, there was just 2 movies worth
   remembering. Why bother?
#. Sail to an island. Climb a mountain. Jump of a cliff.. I am  done
   with roadtrips. I need the X-factor (read, excitement).
#. When I was at school, I never judged people (Silly, innocent me).
   Then, I realized people do that all the time. Find more friends who
   don't judge me. Then I could be back on my don't-give-a-f attitude.
#. The problem with Cable TVs is that I keep channel surfing, even after
   midnight; in the lame hope, that there is something better than
   "sleeping" on the next channel. Should learn to turn it off.
#. It took me forever to realize what an amazing people my family had
   been. All these years, I was unhappy about a not-so-happening
   childhood, when actually they were trying to give me a normal
   childhood, away from their worries. I promise to give back.
#. Meet someone special, who could think on their own, and also who
   don't -giva-a-f to go places on their own.
#. Inspire someone, probably a younger someone. Help them out find their
   destiny.
#. And give and share unconditionally... as if I got millions to spend.
