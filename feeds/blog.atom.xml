On September 24th many a soul around the world participate in a Global Climate Strike. Here I participate with some thoughts I wish to share. The only feasible solution to the Climate Crisis, is not a scientific one, but through policy. It is upto the ones in power - both in industry, finance and politics to make the right call, uproot the system and plant it anew. Why? I am glad you asked.  Let me explain…&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When it comes attitudes on facing Climate Change, there are three kinds of people. They may choose to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ignore or downplay dangers of Climate Change&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;recognize the dangers that await us, but tackle them objectively
rather than emotionally by making lifestyle choices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;take it as a personal crusade, making emotionally attached to the
crisis – which it is – and succumbing to negativity or anger&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which one is the right attitude? I would say all three are flawed
behaviours. My reasons are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ignoring the dangers are what got us into the mess in the first place&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;taking personal responsibility is not enough to make a dent the
system (more on this later)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;protests do works in energising the people around you, but if it has
a detrimental effect if the result is nothing more than &lt;em&gt;be the
change you want to see in the world&lt;/em&gt; and then grieving over it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point I should make it clear that the solutions that we should
focus on is a systemic, economic, industrial and political one. The
science has been clear for far too long. Waiting for a engineering
marvel to save us all is a foolish dream (i.e. it may not happen as soon as we
want it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="taking-personal-responsibility-does-it-work"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Taking personal responsibility - does it work?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recall a conversation between graduate students in Earth sciences commenting
that it is uncomfortable when they go for a one-off mission on a research
vessel to the Arctic, because it is powered by diesel. Some things are
unavoidable, but some are not.  You are not alone. At some point in life I used
to believe so that if I make the right choices towards reducing my carbon
footprint would fix everything.  Less plastic. Less waste. Less cars. Less
electricity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Less is more&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;but not enough&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I am inclined to say that this is &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/10/individuals-climate-crisis-government-planet-priority"&gt;not enough as a society&lt;/a&gt;.  Sure,
small gestures do help, but it always end up in the minority who try to fix
things. The cumulative effect as a society remains virtually unchanged.  Even
if we all choose not to fly, go vegetarian / vegan, consume less and basically
bide time – as most of us have done during Covid-19 pandemic – the emissions
continued to pile up to new &lt;a href="https://public.wmo.int/en/media/press-release/carbon-dioxide-levels-continue-record-levels-despite-covid-19-lockdown"&gt;record levels&lt;/a&gt;.
Why did it happen? It is a systemic issue. A vicious cycle which keeps the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/jul/10/100-fossil-fuel-companies-investors-responsible-71-global-emissions-cdp-study-climate-change"&gt;industry&lt;/a&gt;
(particularly the oil and gas, but also food, transport, energy, construction
and basically everything) functioning as it always had. Market forces such as
fossil-fuel subsidies (which still exists!) would delay the move to a clean,
sustainable society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you know that the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/aug/23/big-oil-coined-carbon-footprints-to-blame-us-for-their-greed-keep-them-on-the-hook"&gt;concept of carbon footprint&lt;/a&gt; was an invention of an oil
company originally intended to shift the blame onto powerless individuals.
Neither did I. At least now that is used to keep tabs on corporations! This
&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiw6_JakZFc"&gt;video essay&lt;/a&gt; by Kurzgesagt also discusses this issue at length.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="how-much-time-do-we-have-left"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How much time do we have left?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists have conservatively &lt;a href="https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/software/app-c3s-global-temperature-trend-monitor?tab=app"&gt;estimated&lt;/a&gt; that at around 2030 we will reach the tipping point of 1.5 degrees warming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;a href="https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/software/app-c3s-global-temperature-trend-monitor"&gt;&lt;img alt="How close are we to reaching a global warming of 1.5˚C?" src="https://fluid.quest/images/global_temp_trend.png" style="width: 100%" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By now you should be convinced that this is an urgent matter. If not have a
look at web app above or &lt;a href="https://climateclock.net/"&gt;this infographic&lt;/a&gt; (Note: it plays some sombre music

have little time left to act.&lt;/p&gt;

The what, the how, the why and all those details for the curious.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TLDR;&lt;/strong&gt; The URL of this website would soon be &lt;a href="https://fluid.quest"&gt;fluid.quest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, on the thirtieth day of August 2021, as rain continue to shower on
Stockholm nearly every day, marks the end of my hunt for a succinct
domain name. For a long time, I was not convinced to spend a good handful of
money on a virtual asset. That changed recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After jumping ships from Blogger, to WordPress, to Tumblr and finally to
&lt;a href="https://pages.github.com/"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; pages using Pelican static-site generator, I thought I was
done. I had full control on the content and the site generation. It was made
using open-source software, which means there was no way the toolchain will not
work in the foreseeable future. Therefore, in short the internals were intact.
Moreover, my precious visitors to my blog then do not get served ads, cookies
or third party tracking scripts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything seemed fine. Until Microsoft bought it. Just because it is a free
service and has a large user base does not inspire any confidence that it might
stay like this forever. I recall how I used to adore following other blogs on
Google Reader until &lt;a href="https://killedbygoogle.com/"&gt;Google swung the axe, decided it was not profitable
enough&lt;/a&gt;. However, feed readers were easy, they
continued to exist, and it was still possible to find alternatives (server based
and server-less). In fact this is not an isolated incident. Large corporations
always change services, buy new ones, shutdown old ones on their whims and
fancies. They would come abruptly, and I should be prepared for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, blog and email servers are like
&lt;a href="https://genius.com/37517]"&gt;Hotel California (&lt;em&gt;You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/a&gt;
as long as you care about others to be able to find you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By buying a domain name, you get an address which stays the same,
irrespective of where you host it. The host could be GitHub, Gitlab,
&lt;a href="https://codeberg.page/"&gt;Codeberg&lt;/a&gt; or even a small server powered by a Raspberry Pi!
The readers will still be able to find you. And as a bonus, you can choose a
domain name which represents your interests better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talking about interests, did you know there are a lot of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Internet_top-level_domains"&gt;TLDs&lt;/a&gt; (top
level domain names) right now. Dull &lt;code&gt;.com&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.net&lt;/code&gt; TLDs of yore are old-fashioned.
The prices can vary a lot! And there are a lot of gotchas to be considered in choosing
the "domain registrar". Where to buy can be confusing to a total beginner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="doing-the-pre-purchase-research"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#doing-the-pre-purchase-research"&gt;Doing the pre-purchase research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research that I did was a bit of informal hearsay in the interweb. For instance the &lt;a href="https://wizardzines.com"&gt;following comics by Julia Evans&lt;/a&gt; were really useful&lt;sup id="fnref:zines"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:zines"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="choosing a domain registrar" src="https://wizardzines.com/comics/registrar/registrar.png"&gt;
&lt;img alt="whois protection can" src="https://wizardzines.com/comics/domain-privacy/domain-privacy.png"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Internet_top-level_domains"&gt;&lt;img alt="TLDs" src="https://wizardzines.com/comics/tld/tld.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;img alt="subdomains" src="https://wizardzines.com/comics/subdomains/subdomains.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this one on receiving
&lt;a href="https://wizardzines.com/comics/receiving-email/"&gt;emails&lt;/a&gt; which I will think
about later. Self-hosting emails is not an easy feat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the choosing the domain registrar question, I got a excellent tip from
&lt;a href="https://jlelse.blog/dev/free-website"&gt;Jan Lukas-Else&lt;/a&gt; who had good experience
with &lt;a href="https://porkbun.com"&gt;Porkbun&lt;/a&gt;. Therefore, I went there and there were many good deals
going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="how-i-bought-the-domain-name"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#how-i-bought-the-domain-name"&gt;How I bought the domain name&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No single correct or optimal answer exists to which domain name one should buy
-- given the plethora of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Internet_top-level_domains"&gt;TLDs&lt;/a&gt; in the market! The &lt;a href="https://porkbun.com/products/domains"&gt;prices&lt;/a&gt; are
nearly fixed for a given TLD. This caught my eye, and I decided to scrap the
table for offline brainstorming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result was a small &lt;a href="https://codeberg.org/ashwinvis/domain-name-search"&gt;domain-name-search Python tool&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By doing so, I was able to check availability of different combinations of
domain names using &lt;code&gt;whois&lt;/code&gt; and visualize costs in an interactive plot. Of
course, it was not perfect, a few domain names which were available were up for
premium registration (prices often exceeding thousands of dollars). Which were
not for me.  Once I had a shortlist done, it was easy to reduce the options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And thus I registered &lt;a href="https://fluid.quest"&gt;fluid.quest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="why-fluidquest"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#why-fluidquest"&gt;Why &lt;a href="https://fluid.quest"&gt;fluid.quest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, I can say that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is an ode to the skill that I have been trained in for nearly a decade, Fluid Mechanics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The quest post Ph.D. still continues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-happens-next"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#what-happens-next"&gt;What happens next?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First I will archive a snapshot of the landing page and this post, in case
someone runs into the blog years later with the old URL and receives a 404
error message, wondering what had happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will soon a register &lt;a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/about-custom-domains-and-github-pages"&gt;the apex domain / subdomain&lt;/a&gt; to point to this
very website via the &lt;a href="https://fluid.quest"&gt;new URL&lt;/a&gt;. Hopefully, all visits to the current URL
&lt;a href="https://ashwinvis.github.io"&gt;ashwinvis.github.io&lt;/a&gt; would be redirected by
&lt;a href="https://pages.github.com/"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; as long I continue to use their service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over a longer period of time, I can turn to a different host with more ethical
business model such as &lt;a href="https://codeberg.page/"&gt;Codeberg&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="update"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#update"&gt;Update&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move is now complete to &lt;a href="https://fluid.quest"&gt;fluid.quest&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You and I must be looking forward to a return to normality and a happy ending
as all children’s books end. However as all stories go, this is anything but
the end. Humanity has been thrust into a series of struggles in this modern
age. As I like to remind myself, it is humanity that needs saving — not life.
Life always finds a way. We have to ensure that we are not the architects of
our own doom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now we face the elephant in the room: the climate emergency, global heating
(erstwhile, global warming) is still on. It did not take a break during the
pandemic as most of us stopped commuting, travelling long distances and sat
home for several months at a stretch. Why? It’s because the energy production
and the economy continued to function as it has always been. A system with
little incentive to reduce emissions without sweeping tax reforms and
regulations to level the playing field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leading up to &lt;a href="https://nitter.snopyta.org/WMO/status/1405872275610554370#m"&gt;Show Your Stripes Day&lt;/a&gt; on 21 June, I took a moment to look at
all the places I have lived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the regions highlighted above, France and Kerala (India) have a stark
contrast in the temperature anomalies in the past two decades. Naturally, in
France owing to heat waves, there has been a wave of climate activism in recent
years. I can vouch personally that summers in Kerala have been unbearable and I
had to install air-conditioning in my home — something that was avoidable in
my childhood. I also recall that during monsoon seasons of 2013 and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Kerala_floods"&gt;2018&lt;/a&gt;
triggered low depressions, widespread torrential rains to such an extent that
dams had to be opened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As most climate scientists believe, if the heating continues and more
greenhouse gases are dumped into the atmosphere, unabated, then extreme events
would become more frequent. I believe that you are aware of all of this. The data
is clear. It is hot everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

No review!” signature campaign and why the existing publishing system needs an overhaul&lt;/p&gt;
</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There are fundamentally several problems with the current publishing model of
scientific articles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Authors toil and work polishing nearly every word of the article&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reviewers volunteer out of goodwill or to keep in touch with research&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Editors coordinate the whole effort&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Libraries or businesses pay to get access to and distribute the end result&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And no-one above in this process gets paid. High charges do not make sense in
the electronic age, when fewer articles get actually printed into hard copy.
Even today with this model, as an author, you will have to pay extra to put a
colour figure which would not be legible in grey scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a documentary describing why this system is ridiculous at best and
predatory at worst.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups" src="https://peertube.social/videos/embed/75ba36d5-1e81-4db4-95b0-8dd4790eb282" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;section id="a-paradigm-shift"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A paradigm shift&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/why-plan-s/"&gt;Plan-S&lt;/a&gt; and Bibsam consortium made a huge dent in this process. This movement gave
libraries and universities the ability and courage to collectively bargain and
walk out of the current subscription model with exorbitant prices. This was a
top-down change and resulted in new deals being made to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;benefit authors to make new articles open-access without the authors
paying a hefty Application Processing Charge (APC), but rather the university
as a whole&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make certain journals open-access or hybrid&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we need now is a grassroots movement, a bottoms-up approach. As authors, we
should be willing to share our research at different stages to preprint servers
(for example, arXiv) and similar outlets (Zenodo, Figshare etc.). The
&lt;a href="https://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/index.php"&gt;Sherpa-Romeo&lt;/a&gt; portal is my go-to tool in finding out what kind of article can
be archived for public-consumption. Also, check with your library to find out
if they could cover the APC charges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as potential reviewers, this &lt;a href="https://nofreeviewnoreview.org/"&gt;campaign&lt;/a&gt; is relevant:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://nofreeviewnoreview.org/"&gt;&lt;img alt="No free view? No review!" class="m-image" src="/static/nfvnr-button.svg" style="width: 50%" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it is our turn as researchers and academics to say no to review articles
which would end up behind a paywall. It is simply not ethical in today’s world.&lt;/p&gt;
