The what, the how, the why and all those details for the curious.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TLDR;&lt;/strong&gt; The URL of this website would soon be &lt;a href="https://fluid.quest"&gt;fluid.quest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, on the thirtieth day of August 2021, as rain continue to shower on
Stockholm nearly every day, marks the end of my hunt for a succinct
domain name. For a long time, I was not convinced to spend a good handful of
money on a virtual asset. That changed recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After jumping ships from Blogger, to WordPress, to Tumblr and finally to
&lt;a href="https://pages.github.com/"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; pages using Pelican static-site generator, I thought I was
done. I had full control on the content and the site generation. It was made
using open-source software, which means there was no way the toolchain will not
work in the foreseeable future. Therefore, in short the internals were intact.
Moreover, my precious visitors to my blog then do not get served ads, cookies
or third party tracking scripts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything seemed fine. Until Microsoft bought it. Just because it is a free
service and has a large user base does not inspire any confidence that it might
stay like this forever. I recall how I used to adore following other blogs on
Google Reader until &lt;a href="https://killedbygoogle.com/"&gt;Google swung the axe, decided it was not profitable
enough&lt;/a&gt;. However, feed readers were easy, they
continued to exist, and it was still possible to find alternatives (server based
and server-less). In fact this is not an isolated incident. Large corporations
always change services, buy new ones, shutdown old ones on their whims and
fancies. They would come abruptly, and I should be prepared for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, blog and email servers are like
&lt;a href="https://genius.com/37517]"&gt;Hotel California (&lt;em&gt;You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/a&gt;
as long as you care about others to be able to find you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By buying a domain name, you get an address which stays the same,
irrespective of where you host it. The host could be GitHub, Gitlab,
&lt;a href="https://codeberg.page/"&gt;Codeberg&lt;/a&gt; or even a small server powered by a Raspberry Pi!
The readers will still be able to find you. And as a bonus, you can choose a
domain name which represents your interests better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talking about interests, did you know there are a lot of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Internet_top-level_domains"&gt;TLDs&lt;/a&gt; (top
level domain names) right now. Dull &lt;code&gt;.com&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.net&lt;/code&gt; TLDs of yore are old-fashioned.
The prices can vary a lot! And there are a lot of gotchas to be considered in choosing
the "domain registrar". Where to buy can be confusing to a total beginner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="doing-the-pre-purchase-research"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#doing-the-pre-purchase-research"&gt;Doing the pre-purchase research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research that I did was a bit of informal hearsay in the interweb. For instance the &lt;a href="https://wizardzines.com"&gt;following comics by Julia Evans&lt;/a&gt; were really useful&lt;sup id="fnref:zines"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:zines"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="choosing a domain registrar" src="https://wizardzines.com/comics/registrar/registrar.png"&gt;
&lt;img alt="whois protection can" src="https://wizardzines.com/comics/domain-privacy/domain-privacy.png"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Internet_top-level_domains"&gt;&lt;img alt="TLDs" src="https://wizardzines.com/comics/tld/tld.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;img alt="subdomains" src="https://wizardzines.com/comics/subdomains/subdomains.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this one on receiving
&lt;a href="https://wizardzines.com/comics/receiving-email/"&gt;emails&lt;/a&gt; which I will think
about later. Self-hosting emails is not an easy feat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the choosing the domain registrar question, I got a excellent tip from
&lt;a href="https://jlelse.blog/dev/free-website"&gt;Jan Lukas-Else&lt;/a&gt; who had good experience
with &lt;a href="https://porkbun.com"&gt;Porkbun&lt;/a&gt;. Therefore, I went there and there were many good deals
going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="how-i-bought-the-domain-name"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#how-i-bought-the-domain-name"&gt;How I bought the domain name&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No single correct or optimal answer exists to which domain name one should buy
-- given the plethora of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Internet_top-level_domains"&gt;TLDs&lt;/a&gt; in the market! The &lt;a href="https://porkbun.com/products/domains"&gt;prices&lt;/a&gt; are
nearly fixed for a given TLD. This caught my eye, and I decided to scrap the
table for offline brainstorming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result was a small &lt;a href="https://codeberg.org/ashwinvis/domain-name-search"&gt;domain-name-search Python tool&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By doing so, I was able to check availability of different combinations of
domain names using &lt;code&gt;whois&lt;/code&gt; and visualize costs in an interactive plot. Of
course, it was not perfect, a few domain names which were available were up for
premium registration (prices often exceeding thousands of dollars). Which were
not for me.  Once I had a shortlist done, it was easy to reduce the options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And thus I registered &lt;a href="https://fluid.quest"&gt;fluid.quest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="why-fluidquest"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#why-fluidquest"&gt;Why &lt;a href="https://fluid.quest"&gt;fluid.quest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, I can say that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is an ode to the skill that I have been trained in for nearly a decade, Fluid Mechanics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The quest post Ph.D. still continues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-happens-next"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#what-happens-next"&gt;What happens next?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First I will archive a snapshot of the landing page and this post, in case
someone runs into the blog years later with the old URL and receives a 404
error message, wondering what had happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will soon a register &lt;a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/about-custom-domains-and-github-pages"&gt;the apex domain / subdomain&lt;/a&gt; to point to this
very website via the &lt;a href="https://fluid.quest"&gt;new URL&lt;/a&gt;. Hopefully, all visits to the current URL
&lt;a href="https://ashwinvis.github.io"&gt;ashwinvis.github.io&lt;/a&gt; would be redirected by
&lt;a href="https://pages.github.com/"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; as long I continue to use their service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over a longer period of time, I can turn to a different host with more ethical
business model such as &lt;a href="https://codeberg.page/"&gt;Codeberg&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="update"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#update"&gt;Update&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move is now complete to &lt;a href="https://fluid.quest"&gt;fluid.quest&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You and I must be looking forward to a return to normality and a happy ending
as all children’s books end. However as all stories go, this is anything but
the end. Humanity has been thrust into a series of struggles in this modern
age. As I like to remind myself, it is humanity that needs saving — not life.
Life always finds a way. We have to ensure that we are not the architects of
our own doom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now we face the elephant in the room: the climate emergency, global heating
(erstwhile, global warming) is still on. It did not take a break during the
pandemic as most of us stopped commuting, travelling long distances and sat
home for several months at a stretch. Why? It’s because the energy production
and the economy continued to function as it has always been. A system with
little incentive to reduce emissions without sweeping tax reforms and
regulations to level the playing field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leading up to &lt;a href="https://nitter.snopyta.org/WMO/status/1405872275610554370#m"&gt;Show Your Stripes Day&lt;/a&gt; on 21 June, I took a moment to look at
all the places I have lived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the regions highlighted above, France and Kerala (India) have a stark
contrast in the temperature anomalies in the past two decades. Naturally, in
France owing to heat waves, there has been a wave of climate activism in recent
years. I can vouch personally that summers in Kerala have been unbearable and I
had to install air-conditioning in my home — something that was avoidable in
my childhood. I also recall that during monsoon seasons of 2013 and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Kerala_floods"&gt;2018&lt;/a&gt;
triggered low depressions, widespread torrential rains to such an extent that
dams had to be opened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As most climate scientists believe, if the heating continues and more
greenhouse gases are dumped into the atmosphere, unabated, then extreme events
would become more frequent. I believe that you are aware of all of this. The data
is clear. It is hot everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
