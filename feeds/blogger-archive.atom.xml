Resolutions, promises to change, and
parties to kickstart the ride. Surprisingly, I find a lot of people,
cheerful all around, everywhere! It is humbling to witness how a random
date, set as the “starting point” of the Earth’s perennial revolution
around the Sun, could collectively influence so many minds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:justify;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:justify;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:justify;"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let us not digress. Instead of piling on more hollow promises, I thought
I would spare a moment and see how things have been. A little over two
years back, I wrote this piece on my blog and called it my &lt;a href="https://bigfatpage.blogspot.in/2011/04/things-to-do-before-i-turn-25.html"&gt;“Bucket
List”&lt;/a&gt;
(didn’t realise back then that the phrase was reference to the idiom,
&lt;em&gt;kick the bucket&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;to die&lt;/em&gt;). Looking back, I am glad that I could
cross out most of the points. Some ride it has been. Went places, learnt
the guitar(mastery would have to wait), started reading again, hardly
watch any movies these days (damn! a stupid idea. What was I thinking?),
met amazing friends, let go of all the miseries and opened up my mind
and yeah, found closure to a 6 year long dream (mmhmm!). All that with
five months left to 25.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is interesting how the course of your life, and your priorities
change in a matter of few years; just when I was starting think that you
hardly change anymore after adulthood. Not just me, I have noticed the
same with all my friends, even the most “inertial” ones yearn change. I
keep getting proved wrong over and over again. Well, Forrest Gump, you
were right. &lt;em&gt;Life is a box of chocolates.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align:justify;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://bigfatpage.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/430080_10150678754909859_666309858_11045588_1531052424_n.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image0" src="https://bigfatpage.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/430080_10150678754909859_666309858_11045588_1531052424_n.jpg?w=300" style="width: 640px" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:justify;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:justify;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:justify;"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What next? Well, the way ahead is still foggy. The only way to find out
is to try and set out on the journey. Uncertain times are exciting! As
things settle down to normalcy, who knows, I might write down another
Bucket List again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:justify;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:justify;"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So for now, Glückliches neues Jahr!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:justify;"&gt;&lt;p&gt;P.S: Although I’m fairly confident that the above translation makes
sense, if it is wrong the blame goes to Google.&lt;/p&gt;

We all come to
a tipping point at times. My friends would know that I get pissed very
rarely, and as far as my memories go, there were only handful of
incidents. And I regret all of them. No good comes out of an angry head.
It is never fun. All it leaves are scars for life. Well, as one of my
friends quoted: &lt;em&gt;“One who angers you, masters you.”&lt;/em&gt; Can’t agree more:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;The more he looked, the more he saw pain in the world yonder.
Wakes up everyday, setting the weight on his shoulders aside,
Navigate from dawn to dusk and watch the sun subside.
Unwillingly, he chased the sunset of his own life.
One more day. One more day closer.

All he yearned was to spread smiles in the journey.
Unfazed by his heartbeats, he told them what they wished to hear.
Yet once a while, he observed the fake world near
Actors, manipulators, crooks, con-artists all around him.
How he wished he could make amends, into the way it should be.
He dived into calmness of the pool around him.

Words escaped his lips, before he thought it through.
Turns back to see chaos, delivered by his words, muddying the pool.
The dirt of his doing dripped down his back as he rose.
Things won't be the same, even in his dreams.

The audience around the pool sneered aloud.
&amp;quot;Lie, you should, if you seek your place in this show of clown
faces,&amp;quot;
Worn he was of pretensions and so he lived on with his
differences.
Mistaken by pride and principles, he might have been.
I ask you, my friend, would you have the courage to do the same?&lt;/pre&gt;

he’s called. Ever wondered why he’s crouching so low? Some may say he’s
deep in his thought. I beg to differ. It is the weight of his
preoccupation hanging on his shoulders. Can’t you see this guy is
depressed?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/45/The_Thinker,_Auguste_Rodin.jpg/321px-The_Thinker,_Auguste_Rodin.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image0" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/45/The_Thinker,_Auguste_Rodin.jpg/321px-The_Thinker,_Auguste_Rodin.jpg" style="width: 214px; height: 320px" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing too much can be a pain in the neck. To be enlightened about
world (read: too much of news, Facebook shares, Twitter, TV, and
Googling) burdens your mind with negativity. Then, your dear friend make
you sit and watch a bunch of Youtube conspiracy theories. Follows a
ranting session on “how the world has gone to the dogs”, “scams”,
“corporates”, and “corruption”. Keep doing that, and before you know it,
you’ll end up bitter and start sneering at everything around you.
Now that we have established media hype and bias, what’s your next best
option? They say &lt;em&gt;ignorance is bliss&lt;/em&gt;. So, it would have been better to
not read the news, drink a cup of coffee and enjoy the evening, right?
WRONG! It’s no fun being a dumb retard either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choose your sources wisely.&lt;/strong&gt; If you read the Times of India
regularly and believe in all the speculations on Aaj Tak, lobotomy is
your best option. (Not just these two, but I could name other lost
causes.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be curious. Question.&lt;/strong&gt; Most of the conspiracy theories and e-mail
hoaxes are with “evidence” that are webpages on the Net itself.
Authentic, isn’t it? I’m not asking you to Google to prove it. It’s
like that line in &lt;em&gt;Alchemist:  * “*When you want something, all the
universe conspires in helping you to achieve it&lt;/em&gt;.” Google will always
deliver whatever you seek. Don’t mug up any such fact on the net.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow blogs and opinions by unbiased&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;people.&lt;/strong&gt; That my friend,
is a good start to clear your head and form opinions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here are some “few good men”:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href="https://chomsky.info/articles.htm"&gt;Noam Chomsky&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.rameshsrivats.net/"&gt;Ramesh
Srivats&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.richarddawkins.net/"&gt;Richard
Dawkins&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
and many political satirists like: Jon Stewart, Stephen Colbert,
Sumeet Raghavan. Do tell me if there are others of the same repute. I
would be interested.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:justify;"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve been away from my homeland, for two years straight. Situations
throw you into a mish-mash  of people hailing from all over India, and I
accept, it was weird and unsettling in the beginning. But you change
overtime, slowly. And armed with the following superpowers vested in
you, life out there is cakewalk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:justify;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Listen and adapt -&lt;/strong&gt; I don’t know how true this is, but a friend of
mine said that Malayalam is the second most difficult language to
learn, right under Mandarin. But it seems plausible, since it is an
elaborately designed tongue. The uninitiated would find it hard to
even tell the words apart as we speak! There are hardly any breaks
between words - it just rolls and gurgles on to the end. Since it’s
hard for others to learn our language, you are left with no option,
but to learn theirs - which comes with ease, slowly but surely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encrypted tongue -&lt;/strong&gt; It works most of the time. You could shout and
abuse each other in the metro, in the bus, or even in the middle of
the road, and no one would have a clue. Somethings that you don’t get
to do back home. But…. there is a catch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wherever you go, they are there -&lt;/strong&gt; It’s like an epidemic. You find
them everywhere, even where you don’t expect them at all! Sometimes
they just pretend to be an outsider, and overhear all your
conversations. And they’d just leave with a oneliner in Malayalam at
the end, making you look like a total  ശശി .&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One for all, and all for one -&lt;/strong&gt; Back in Kerala, you just get tired
of seeing too many “blaady mallus.” But once you realise you are
alone, even a complete stranger would seem like a long lost friend
(if he’s some random connection with you, god help him). And you
would end up conversing stuff that you normally wouldn’t … to a
stranger, c’mon! You are that vulnerable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of day, you have your bunch of friends, who reassure you that
the place you live in is a home away from home. That occasional taste of
the native cuisine, is enough to drive your miseries away and keep you
going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:justify;"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Jim Carrey said (on a lighter note, of course) we are always just one
step away from insanity. Your mind is a pandora’s box that cooks up all
the evil you could do at “the moment.” Read these weird thoughts; you
might have had them before - from time to time. Be it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;jumping off the cliff while being awestruck at the suicide point, or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dancing in the middle of the road, or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;imagining yourself beating the shit out of a guy in front of you,
going on… and on… speaking nothing other than bullshit (with a
baseball bat when the situation demands it).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:justify;"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your brain is a weird place. It is like a super-computer which figures
out all the possible chess moves in front of you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:justify;"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is that tiny voice inside your head that holds you back from all the
wrong, insane, suicidal moves. It just tells you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

 *"Uh-uh-uhh.... It's counter-productive!* "&lt;p&gt;And you stop. You throw all those thoughts away in the trash can. Let’s
call it the &lt;strong&gt;voice of control&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align:justify;"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The catch is - you can’t control that voice in your head. Reasoning and
logic can only bargain a little. You can never turn it off. If we were
allowed to do it, anarchists, psychopaths and criminals will be all
around. So it is fine the way it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://bigfatpage.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/devilandangel.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image0" src="https://bigfatpage.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/devilandangel.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:justify;"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, there is another voice. Unlike the voice of control, which asks
you to stop; this is like an inner urge which ask you to &lt;em&gt;start doing
stuff,&lt;/em&gt; that you normally, “logically” don’t want to do. To make the
idea simple enough, let’s call it the &lt;strong&gt;voice of heart&lt;/strong&gt;. Although it
feels like a pounding in your head more than the heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:justify;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;be it helping out a good friend in need, when you have “loads” of
work to do on your own; or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a parent taking his/her kid to the children’s park even though he/she
is worn out after a day’s work; or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;falling in love and that lingering infatuation or crush; or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;helping out someone you care with shopping, although you couldn’t
stand shopping when you’re not doing it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;No matter how much you have planned and premeditated, that you won’t do
it, you &lt;strong&gt;finally&lt;/strong&gt; end up doing it. You will break your own plan, and
there you go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The catch here too, is that you can’t stop it. Maybe if you are really
strong at heart (figuratively), and have a will of steel, you can fight
it out, and suppress it. But still, the pounding in the head remains.
The voice shouts back at you for being an insensitive prick, and you are
filled with regret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;These random voices are what end up as decisions and what makes us
human. Unique, unpredictable, but equally compassionate beings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
P.S.: Correct me if I’m wrong. Just feel free to reply.&lt;br /&gt;
Jim Carrey’s take : &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/lbqxkS2ssUI?t=5m3s"&gt;https://youtu.be/lbqxkS2ssUI?t=5m3s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
