Summary: I bought a domain name - an address, a virtual place to call it home. The what, the how, the why and all those details for the curious.

**TLDR;** The URL would soon be [blog.fluid.quest][blog]

Today, the thirtieth day of August 2021, as rain continue to shower on
Stockholm nearly every day, I dedicated a few days on the hunt for a succinct
domain name. For a long time, I was not convinced to spent a good handful of
money on a virtual assets.

After jumping ships from Blogger, to Wordpress, to Tumblr and finally to
[GitHub][GitHub] pages using Pelican static-site generator, I thought I was
done. I had full control on the content and the site generation. It was made
using open-source software, which means there was no way the toolchain will not
work in the foreseeable future. Therefore, in short the internals were intact.
Moreover, my precious visitors to my blog then do not get served ads, cookies
or third party tracking scripts.

Everything seemed fine. Until Microsoft bought it. Just because it is a free
service and has a large user base does not give you any guarantee that it might
stay like this forever. I recall how I used to adore following other blogs on
Google Reader until [Google swung the axe, decided it was not profitable
enough](https://killedbygoogle.com/). However feed readers were easy, they
continued to exist and it was still possible to find alternatives (server based
and server-less). In fact this is not an isolated incident. Large corporations
always change services, buy new ones, shutdown old ones on their whims and
fancies. They would come abruptly and I should be prepared for this. And blog
and email servers are like [Hotel California (*You can check out any time you
like, but you can never leave*)][california] as long as you are dependent on
others to reach you.

By buying a domain name, you get an address which can stay the same,
irrespective of where you host it. The host could be GitHub, Gitlab,
[Codeberg][codeberg] or even a small server powered by a Raspberry Pi!
The readers will still be able to find you. And as a bonus, you can choose a
domain name which represents your interests better.

Talking about interests, did you know there are a lot of [TLDs][TLDs] (top
level domain names) right now. Dull .com, .net of yore are old-fashioned.
The prices can vary a lot! Where to buy can be confusing to a total beginner.


## What happens next?

First I will archive a snapshot of the landing page and this post, in case someone runs into the blog
years later and receives a 404, wondering what had happened.

I will soon a register [subdomain][subdomain] to point to this very website to
the [new URL][blog]. Hopefully, all visits to the current URL
[ashwinvis.github.io](https://ashwinvis.github.io) would be redirected by
[GitHub][GitHub] as long I continue to use their service.

Over a longer period of time, I can turn to a different host with more ethical
business model such as [Codeberg][codeberg].
