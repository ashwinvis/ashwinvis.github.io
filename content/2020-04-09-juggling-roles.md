It is not exactly lock-down in Sweden, but it is a voluntary work-from-home for
everyone. As a concerned parent, even if the preschools are open, we have
chosen not to send our preschooler to school. It is easier said than done.

I should share resources that my daughter found interesting, and I really
approve of.

## Apps
- [Khan Academy Kids](https://learn.khanacademy.org/khan-academy-kids/) - A
  really nice app with diverse tasks. Has enough material to function online and
  offline.
- [Tripp Trapp Trad](https://www.ur.se/tripp-trapp-trad) - A tree with some fun
  activities around it.[^1]
- [GCompris](https://gcompris.net/index-en.html) - FOSS Educational
  cross-platform application.

## Videos
- [SVT play](https://www.svtplay.se/kanaler) [^1]
- [UR play](https://urplay.se/bladdra/barn) [^1]
- [Come Play With Me](https://invidious.snopyta.org/channel/UCQ00zWTLrgRQJUb8MHQg21A) [^2]
- [NFB Canada Short films](https://www.nfb.ca/channels/based-childrens-books/)

## Things that I have not followed through
- [Daily Schedule from Khan Academy](https://keeplearning.khanacademy.org/daily-schedule#Pre-K-1-2)
- [Varsity Tutors](https://www.varsitytutors.com) - Both paid and free lessons
    on a wide variety of topics themed as [Virtual School
    Days](https://www.varsitytutors.com/virtual-school-day) and [Virtual Field
    Trips](https://www.varsitytutors.com/classes/featured-collections/virtual-field-trips?f_class_size=large-group0).
    I have signed up to see how it is like. The only trouble is to sign in to
    get access to the content.
