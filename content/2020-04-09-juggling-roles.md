It is not exactly lock-down in Sweden, but it is a voluntary work-from-home for
everyone. As a concerned parent, even if the preschools are open, we have
chosen not to send our daughter to school. It is easier said than done.

I should share resources that my daughter found interesting, and I really
approve of.
