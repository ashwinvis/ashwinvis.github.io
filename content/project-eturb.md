Summary: eTurb: Efficient simulations of turbulence in atmospheric boundary layers
---

Since October 1, 2019 I have been working as a postdoc at MISU, Stockholm
University. There has been a couple of meetings with the group involved, and
now the *who* and the *what* are more concrete. I wrote a short abstract for
the [annual FLOW catalogue](https://www.flow.kth.se/projects), which I share
below.

The atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) is the region which interacts with the
Earth’s surface and exchanges energy between larger geophysical scales and
land. The ABL goes through different regimes of stratification during the
day-night transition, referred to as the diurnal cycle. Daytime convection
results in a mixed layer when the boundary layer depth increases, and during
night as the land cools, a shallower stably stratified boundary layer is
observed. Accurate representation of turbulence in the ABL is crucial e.g. to
improve weather predictions and for wind-energy applications. A suitable tool
for studying the turbulence and complex transient phenomena in the ABL during a
typical diurnal cycle is large-eddy simulation (LES).

This project aims to tackle different modelling challenges along the road to an
efficient LES of the ABL. From the physics perspective, the wall boundary
condition and the LES subgrid-scale model need to be improved to allow for high
resolution simulations. Existing models should also be verified with regards to
numerical stability and consistency. A desired outcome of this project is an
efficient and accurate code for an LES of diurnal cycle of the ABL. To
coordinate this inter-disciplinary project a collaboration between KTH, SU, LiU
and SMHI is set afoot. For the LES we will use the Nek5000 (KTH and SU) and
ESSENSE (LiU and SMHI) codes.
