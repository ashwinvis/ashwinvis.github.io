places across the world, slowly but surely,

You and I must be looking forward to a return to normality and a happy ending
as all children's books end. However as all stories go, this is anything but
the end. Humanity has been thrust into a series of struggles in this modern
age. As I like to remind myself, it is humanity that needs saving --- not life.
Life always finds a way. We have to ensure that we are not the architects of
our own doom.

Now we face the elephant in the room: the climate emergency, global heating
(erstwhile, global warming) is still on. It did not take a break during the
pandemic as most of us stopped commuting, travelling long distances and sat
home for several months at a stretch. Why? It's because the energy production
and the economy continued to function as it has always been. A system with
little incentive to reduce emissions without sweeping tax reforms and
regulations to level the playing field.

I take that you are aware of all of this. I take a moment to look at all the
places I have lived. The data is clear. It is hot everywhere.
