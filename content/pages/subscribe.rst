Two ways: Atom_ feed or Mastodon_.

Atom_
=====

This blog delivers updates via Atom_ feeds, a sibling of RSS_ format. To use
it, you need a reader -- you can find some `suggestions here`_.

.. note-info::

    I publish atom feeds for

    - `All articles <//feeds/all.atom.xml>`__
    - `Category: Blog <//feeds/blog.atom.xml>`__
    - `Category: Tech Talk <//feeds/tech-talk.atom.xml>`__

You can send responses via email_.

Mastodon_
=========
I often announce my blog posts on `my Mastodon profile`_ - where you could
follow  and even send responses too.

For the uninitiated, Mastodon_ is a micro blog which talks to other servers
like e-mail. More accurately, it is one among many software solutions which
forms a network called Fediverse_.  There are several server instances you can
join_.

.. note-info::

   - `My Mastodon profile`_
   - `Follow me with an account on Fediverse`_
   - `Follow me without an account via RSS`_
