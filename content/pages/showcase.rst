Sponsors

.. note-dim:: None so far ðŸ¤”

Most of the things I write and code are out of my own sheer passion. Only space and
time limit my output. I do have a full-time job to keep me busy, but that said
, I would not mind some encouragement from readers like you.

Currently there are two sponsorship tiers, with which you could:

- receive a special *thank you* email
- be added to the list of *sponsors* in my blog

If you feel like, head over to my **GitHub sponsors** dashboard:

    My tip jar

Once things start looking up, I might open up more sponsorship tiers like one
for:

- allowing me to spare an hour per month to *talk about anything* you want via instant message / video call
- requesting *features or bug fixes on a project* that I have already contributed to
