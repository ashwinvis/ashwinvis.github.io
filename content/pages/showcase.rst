Most of the things I write and code are out of my own sheer passion. Only space and
time limit my output. I do have a full-time job to keep me busy, but that said
, I would not mind some encouragement from readers like you.  If you feel like,
head over to either of the following:

Liberapay

Many flexible ways to chip in a tip:

    `ðŸ’“ Sponsor <https://github.com/sponsors/ashwinvis>`__

Currently there are two sponsorship tiers, with which you could:

- receive a special *thank you* email
- be added to the list of *sponsors* in my blog


Once things start looking up, I might open up more sponsorship tiers like one
for:

- allowing me to spare an hour per month to *talk about anything* you want via instant message / video call
- requesting *features or bug fixes on a project* that I have already contributed to
