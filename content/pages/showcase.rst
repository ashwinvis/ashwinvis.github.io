My current research is about atmospheric boundary layer turbulence studied
using large-eddy simulations (LES).  *Other research interests* include
geophysical flows, stratified flows, instabilities, scientific computing.
Building simple, efficient, open-source, and reproducible software fascinate
me.

I have curated some of my works in this website. Take a look.
