.. note-dim:: None so far ðŸ¤”

Most of the things I write and code are out of my own sheer passion. Only space and
time limit my output. I do have a full-time job to keep me busy, but that said
, I would not mind some encouragement from readers like you.  If you feel like,
head over to either of the following:

Liberapay
=========

Many flexible ways to chip in a tip:

GitHub sponsors

   <style>
      div.gh-sponsors-button a {
         display: block;
         text-decoration: none;
         font-size: 0.9em;
         font-family: sans-serif;
         font-weight: bold;
         color: #000;
         padding: 0.2em 1em;
     }
     div.gh-sponsors-button {
         display: inline-block;
         background-color: #ddd;
         border: none;
         border-radius: 0.5rem;
         text-align: center;
     }
   </style>

Currently there are two sponsorship tiers, with which you could:

- receive a special *thank you* email
- be added to the list of *sponsors* in my blog

.. container:: gh-sponsors-button m-default

    `ðŸ’“ Sponsor <https://github.com/sponsors/ashwinvis>`__

Once things start looking up, I might open up more sponsorship tiers like one
for:

- allowing me to spare an hour per month to *talk about anything* you want via instant message / video call
