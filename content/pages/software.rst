Research Software
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

snek5000_
'''''''''

On my postdoc role, I started using Nek5000_, is a really popular Fortran 77 HPC
code. Using it is bittersweet experience:

- loads of features
- good performance ðŸš€
- monolithic, uses in-house build tools
- utilizes several legacy Fortran anti-features

On the bright side, as a user there is a separation of the user code and
parameters from the Nek5000_ core. This fact was exploited to create
snek5000_ to create a pythonic API to effortlessly launch simulations with
varying parameters.

pymech_
'''''''
A collection of I/O utilities to operate on files produced by Nek5000_. Along
with other friends, I maintain and improve the package.

`FluidDyn project <https://foss.heptapod.net/fluiddyn>`__
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

An ecosystem of packages for research and teaching in fluid dynamics.

Some key features include:

-  `FluidDyn <https://fluiddyn.readthedocs.io>`__: Classes to manage
   parameters, large sets of files, named numpy arrays, scripting job
   submissions in clusters, MPI wrappers to easily implement sequential
   and parallel programming.
-  `FluidFFT <https://fluidfft.readthedocs.io>`__: Unified Python and
   C++ API for various sequential and MPI & GPU accelerated FFT
   implementations.
-  `FluidSim <https://fluidsim.readthedocs.io>`__: Arguably one of
   fastest CFD framework specializing in pseudospectral solvers, with
   on-the-fly post processing. Example of a research done using
   FluidSim:
