I had little knowledge that the FOSS movement had reached home.
Most of the efforts have been towards
[internationalization and
localization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization)
of software, and in particular FOSS software, with advancing the status of the
Indian languages in the digital era. As a child, I saw no point
in spending a lot of effort in artificially constructing technical terms and
implementing them in software interfaces, while most students in India are at
least bilingual and most of the times trilingual.

But now, I understand the importance - in the digital era, as paper in the form
of notebooks, newspaper and books get replaced by tablets, laptops, websites
and e-books, it is imperative and critical for the survival of a language that
it is seen and read in digital media. Only the daily use of language determines
its sustained life, without risking extinction.

To that end, I see that the following community projects are interesting:

* [Swathanthra Malayalam Computing](https://smc.org.in) - Fonts, dictionaries,
  TTS and translations for GNU/Linux desktop OS. 
* [Varnam project](https://www.varnamproject.com/), 
  [online](https://www.varnamproject.com/editor) and
  [desktop](https://subinsb.com/varnam-easily-type-malayalam-indian-languages/)
  editors:
  A library and an application to allow for transliteration from Latin
  characters into Malayalam and other Indian languages. This is crucial as many
  millenials would prefer to write _ingane_ as opposed to ഇങ്ങനെ .

Are there more grassroots movements in the spirit of FOSS that I am unaware of?
Let me know!
