I have been witnessing the evolution of smart phones into fragile and data
hungry beasts that they are today, crippling essential features such as:

* 3.5 mm headphone jacks
* removable batteries
* ability to unlock the bootloader (root)
* install a new OS (flash)
* reliance on Google Play Services for even mainstream apps such as BankID in
  Sweden
* lack of spare parts and support in a couple of years

And as a result I have resisted the urge of getting a new phone for the past 2
months. But with Covid-19, I accept that having a phone around is essential to
stay in touch with close ones.

After much contemplation my criteria boiled down to the following:

1. Repairable with long-term support: both software updates and hardware
   warranty.
2. Community support in an effort to develop towards a working Linux phone.

The candidates were
[PinePhone](https://ubports.com/blog/ubports-blog-1/post/pinephone-ubports-community-edition-pre-orders-are-open-271)
at \$150 and [Fairphone 3](https://shop.fairphone.com/en/) at €475. In
comparison with the existing market these phones have have medium
specifications. However I put the above two criteria over all shiny details
that people tend to care more about like looks, performance and camera. I have
a stand-alone camera and a gaming device, so why should I bother?

## Why and why not PinePhone

The advantages of PinePhone is it already "works" with existing Linux projects
such as:

- [postmarketOS](https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Devices)
- [UBports](https://ubports.com/)

and it is cheap. However the company only started working on phones [a year
ago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pine_Microsystems#Smartphone) and when I
checked the availability of spare parts, the most essential one which is a
[battery](https://store.pine64.org/?product=pinephone-lithium-battery-only-ship-in-us-2)
only ships in US and was out of stock. Also there is hardly any warranty.

## But Fairphone...?

At the cost it is selling it is as expensive as so-called "flagship" phones.
The cost covers:

- sourcing rare materials from non war-torn regions
- providing fair work conditions for factories in China
- recycling old phones
- modularity and support

While Fairphone 2 is no longer in sale, it is one of the featured phones by the
UBPorts project. Fairphone 3 right now does not have a Linux OS option, and not
even a "unGoogled" Android ROM such as [Lineage
OS](https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/). It will take some time for the
developers to get it to working condition, because [ARM
development](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/smartphones/) is a lot of
work. The /e/ foundation - a fork of Lineage OS is [working on
it](https://mastodon.social/@e_mydata/103912398236907028).


**All you need is a little push in the right direction.**

- There is a hardware warranty for two years
- Fairphone continues to sell spare parts for older phones
- Assured software updates for 5 years
- Official tutorial on [unlocking the
  bootloader](https://support.fairphone.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041655711-Unlock-the-bootloader-of-your-Fairphone-3)

As for the price, if it is any consolation, compare the to an average grocery
shopping which would be around €50 in Sweden, it is not so expensive.  I got a
discount code at the end, which I wish I received earlier. So I might as well
share it here.

No, I was not paid to write this, but I really like the concept and I hope more
such projects emerge. Let's work towards a [circular
economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_economy).
