A tribute to the year past.

   <div style="text-align:justify;">

Last year was one in which I wrote so little about myself. Even if I did
so, I did it with caution. The reason? Because I realized the power
words hold. A few spoken words, may it be a joke or a random comment,
can change the course of many lives around. This very prospect was
scary. And I was holding my words for the same reason.

Now? Well, today I could say with a bright smile on my face that I know
where I am headed and who I am taking along in this journey. And now I
am no longer on thin ice. That's right, I found **the One**.

Her name is Neelu.M And probably dear reader, you might have heard the
story of how we met, how we started off, how things fell in place and
here we are now. So I won't drag you through that now. What you might
not know is how a relationship changes you, as the bond grows deeper and
stronger. This is a question Sailesh (Yes, names! I am taking the
liberty of quoting real people) asked. I hope to answer this. I write
this as a note to self, as the memory of 2013-14 is still afresh in my
mind. And I wish not to forget it, ever.

.. rubric:: *"How are wedding preparations going on?"*
   :name: how-are-wedding-preparations-going-on

**Tip**: Please save the bride and groom from asking this question.
Chances are that preparations have not started rolling, and they have
answered this query umpteen times. Yet, they would ** still reply, as
what else is there to ask right? The weather? NO!

.. rubric:: *"How's life after marriage?"*
   :name: hows-life-after-marriage

People can be really curious. As curious as about what comes after
death? Truth be told, Neelu and me still need to find a proper reply to
this question. Thinking about which, actually, the two of us haven't
felt the wave of change hitting us. Maybe it is a gradual process. Not
like a step function (courtesy - my good friend Chandrasekhar).
