Nothing could be more sore than sitting devoid of company in a train.
For long i held this opinion. It was a hot saturday afternoon and I was
stuck in the Chennai mail homebound. As I was early to reach the
station, I managed to grab a seat in the general coach. A girl entered
the train with her mother. Soon her father called her on the phone
asking where they were. She replied, "Just come into coupe next to which
a mammen is standing, with a newspaper on his head." The guy to right
suddenly asked, "What if that mammen moves past?" The girl prayed
otherwise.

For a few passing minutes, i stared at a guy dressed like a pimp, who
stood by the aisle. French beard, violet t-shirt with huge prints,
egg-white wrist watch... "Interesting," I thought. It wasn't long
before, the way he spoke made me realise he was that average college
boy. Father came and the train bade goodbye to hot, simmering station.

I spent the 1st dragging hour staring at the amusements my phone. All i
could think of was my bumÂ  gettin numb. Heaven sent a guy, asking me to
get up and stuff his bags. Relief at last... I got rid of my gadget as i
hit kollam. Transforming into a rubberneck, i saw the multitude of
passengers who sat nearby... This was quite a queer lot.

| On the windowside opposite was a blind schoolteacher, who held his bag
  close to him. And next to me sat a man of sixties, who attempted to
  make small talk with the blind gentleman with little success. The
  weirdest was a family of three- a husband , a wife and a young girl,
  who were determined to battle their way till Chennai in the general
  coupe. To the right sat a pair of artists who were completely
  strangers when they entered the train. Getting to know each other,
  they couldn't stop themselves from bragging about 'the ailings of the
  entertainers'. Reality shows and egos of the 'superstars' hit bigtime
  between their gossips.
