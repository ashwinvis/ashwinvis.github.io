Plan, one step at a time. 

    * **It is a mistake to look too far ahead. Only one link in the chain of
      destiny can be handled at a time.**

    * **It is always wise to look ahead, but difficult to look further than you
      can see. // (Sir Winston Churchill)**

| 21, an age at which we legally turn adults, willing to take our own
  choices (yeah, by all means).
| We stand at crossroads, yet few of us realise the same. The very
  ground that we stand now, defines us in the days, months and years to
  come.... Yet, few are shaken by the gravity of that decision.

| That one decision:

-  that  job, you plan to blindly chase in the 1-2 years to follow
-  that family business, which you plan to take care of
-  that university, which you always dreamt of being a part of
-  or even that soul mate, for whom you gave your heart, and made
   promises


**Everything matters**. Search to the bottom of your soul, what you
yearn.

Think about how "you think" life will be like after that one step. Work
to earn it. Follow it with all you've got. 

It all comes down to one small fundamental principle of happiness:

    NO REGRETS

And for all fellow beings planning to "go with the flow" and later on
"settle".
Trust me, it may seem the easy way, but it is the most dangerous path.

You are talking about settling for 40 years ahead, when already you
have grown vary of living the same life for just 20 years!
*Vita longa* (Life is long), explore it in all its glory.

Farewell!
