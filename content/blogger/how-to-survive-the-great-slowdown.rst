On the backdrop of recent events when our beloved `King Singh gave a
heartbroken I-day
speech <https://in.reuters.com/article/2012/08/15/india-gdp-manmohan-singh-idINDEE87E01I20120815>`__,
`all hope seems to be
lost <https://in.reuters.com/article/2012/08/18/india-economy-gdp-panel-idINDEE87G02G20120818>`__
and the media starts scaring you with `impending
doom <https://in.reuters.com/article/2012/08/18/india-ratings-junk-investment-idINDEE87F0IK20120818>`__;
I thought I would share a few pointers that would help the *selfish
anarchist* in you survive in the days ahead.

There are some nonsensical things we do, that are considered OK. I
wouldn't actually call it austerity measures. Think about these and see
if you can stop doing them.

#. **Start cutting down on overpriced junk food.** A few months ago, I
   saw a donation box in KFC that wanted me to donate some spare change
   to conquer "hunger in the world". Makes you feel guilty, doesn't it?
   I was holding that pricey burger in my hand, and I realized that I
   don't actually need it.
#. **Get used to cheap transport**. Once you are employed and you have
   the luxury of commuting in your own motorbikes and buying Air trips
   back and forth, its hard to imagine going back to school-days when
   your pocket money was a 100 Rs. ($2 in those days. Not now.) note for
   a month. Brush up your footboard-hanging and hitchhiking skills.
#. **Recognize your *first-world* *problems* and deal with it.** When
   you are in your comfort zone, it's natural that you dig up
   discomforts in your daily routine, and cry about it to make your life
   miserable.
   Like you never have enough time, the food in the canteen is either
   too spicy or not spicy enough, your broadband is not broad enough,
   the girls in your college/workplace are not outdoorsy enough, the
   beer you get is too bitter and there is no end to this rant.
   I have done it too; and I despise myself for doing it. Trust me you
   would have lots to complain about, in the future.

   Go by that thought.

   Recommended watch: `Into the
   Wild <https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0758758/>`__ - essentially a primer
   course in living with no money.
