Summary: |
  On September 24th many a soul around the world participate in a Global
  Climate Strike. Here I participate with some thoughts I wish to share here. The
  only possible solution to the Climate Crisis is through policy. It is upto the
  ones in power - both in industry, finance and politics to make the right call
  and uproot the system to plant it anew. Why? I am glad you asked. Let me
  explain...

There are three kinds of mindsets. They may:

1. ignore or downplay dangers of Climate Change
1. recognize the dangers that await us, but tackle them objectively rather than emotionally by making lifestyle choices
1. take it as a personal crusade, making emotionally attached to the crisis -- which it is -- and succumbing to negativity or anger

Which one is the right attitude? I would say all three are flawed behaviours. My reasons are as follows:

1. ignoring the dangers are what got us into the mess in the first place
1. taking personal responsibility is not enough to make a dent the system (more on this later)
1. protests do works in energising the people around you, but if it has a
   detrimental effect if the result is nothing more than *be the change you
   want to see in the world* and then grieving over it

At this point I should make it clear that the solutions that we should
focus on is a systemic, economic, industrial and political one. The science has
been clear for far too long. Waiting for a engineering marvel to save us all is
a foolish dream.

Taking personal responsibility - does it work?
----------------------------------------------

I am inclined to say no. Even if we choose not to fly, go vegetarian / vegan,
consume less and basically bide time -- as most of us have done during Covid-19
pandemic the emissions continued to pile up to new [record
levels][recordlevels]. Why did it happen? The [industry][industry]
(particularly the oil and gas, but also food, transport, energy, construction
and basically everything) continued to function.
