Compared to last time I tried it (a year or two ago), now the [IndieKit project](https://getindiekit.com) has matured and is fairly well documented. I have deployed my [micropub server](https://github.com/ashwinvis/ashwinvis-micropub) to allow for effortless micro blogging to my Pelican blog. 

Since Pelican style metadata was not available, I had to implement it. I learned a bit of NodeJS development in the process - it was not easy.
